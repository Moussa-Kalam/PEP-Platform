        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          MentorMe, the Passion Empowerment Platform, was born out of a single
          idea: to break down the barriers that limit individual growth and
          creativity. Our founder, Moussa, witnessed the untapped potential in
          students back in his home country, and that ignited a fire with him to
          create a space where passions could flourish
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <p>
          Our vision is to revolutionize education by making it personal,
          purposeful, and passionate. We envision a world where students aren't
          just learners, but also explorers, creators, and leaders of their own
          journey.
        </p>
